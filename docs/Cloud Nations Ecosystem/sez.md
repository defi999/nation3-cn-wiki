# ðŸŒŽ Special economic zones

A **[special economic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_economic_zone)** (**SEZ**) is an area in which the business and trade laws are different from the rest of the host country.

Although the managing entity can have almost total control over the land, the host country usually reserves certain rights (and certain laws stay in place) and ultimately owns the land.
