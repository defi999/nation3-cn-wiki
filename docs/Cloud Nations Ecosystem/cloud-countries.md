# 🏳️‍🌈 Cloud countries

**Cloud countries** are communities that provide or aim to provide services similar to those of a nation state. But, instead of starting up with land, they start up building services and amassing a community on the Internet, with the aim to eventually expand into the physical realm.

- [Kong](https://kong.land): Cloud country with token-based citizenship, physical passports and [its own physical/digital currency](https://kong.cash).
- [Plumia](https://plumia.country): Kickstarted by [SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com), Plumia aims to create a cloud country of remote workers and nomads.
- [Praxis](https://www.praxissociety.com): Praxis is a grassroots movement of modern pioneers building a new city.
