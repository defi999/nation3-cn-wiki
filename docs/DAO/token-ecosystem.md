**Token Flow Chart
**![token flow chart](/img/Token_flow_chart.png "")

## $NATION
$NATION is required in order to mint passport NFTs and become a citizen of Nation3. This ensures that citizens have long-term economic alignment.

$NATION therefore acts as a dynamic pricing mechanism for citizenship.

It also allows the DAO to finance itself, as the DAO holds the majority of the initial supply.

**Information**

- Initial supply: 42069 $NATION

**How to get $NATION**

You can buy $NATION from [here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/trade/ether/0x333a4823466879eef910a04d473505da62142069).

You can provide liquidity to the NATION/ETH pool [here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x0bf37157d30dfe6f56757dcadff01aed83b08cd600020000000000000000019a).

## $veNATION
$veNATION holders are those that bring more capital than time to the DAO. They take $NATION out of circulation due to their long-term commitment, creating a sink that might serve for $NATION to accrue value, and therefore capitalizing the Nation3 DAO.

In turn, thanks to that, members who commit their time can advance the mission of the DAO by making proposals, conducting research, and carrying out initiatives.

$veNATION token is non-transferrable and can only be accessed by staking $NATION for a period from 1 week up to 4 years.

The $veNATION balance is calculated based on the following model: 

1 $NATION locked for 4 years = 1 $veNATION
1 $NATION locked for 3 years = 0.75 $veNATION
1 $NATION locked for 2 years = 0.5 $veNATION
1 $NATION locked for 1 years = 0.25 $veNATION

You can can use this [calculator](https://app.nation3.org/lock) to model your desired amount and time lock. 

The amount of $veNATION for each $NATION staked correlates with the duration of the lock and it decreases as the time passes. 

**For example:**

Joe staked 10 $NATION for 4 years and received 10 $veNATION. 

3 years later, when there is only 1 year of the lock remaining, Joe's $veNATION balance will drop to 2.5. At the end of the lock his $NATION balance, however, will remain the original 10.

It's important to keep this in mind when getting the NFT passport, since over time your $veNATION balance may drop below the required amount. You can always lock more $NATION to maintain the correct amount. 

**Holdersâ€™ rights:**

- $veNATION holders are entitled to claim an NFT passport, should you want to become a Nation3 citizen. There will be a requirement of holding a minimum of 2 $veNATION to claim a Genesis NFT passport.
- Because longer-term commitment magnifies $veNATION holdings, $veNATION breaks the barrier to participation for those with minimal funds available: staking for 4 years will take you less $NATION to achieve the same $veNATION balance as someone staking much more $NATION for 1 month.

**Holdersâ€™ responsibilities:** 

- Governance responsibility is limited to ratifying the proposals made by Nation3 citizens â€” which is key for the project, yet requires minimal time commitment.

**Holdersâ€™ financial incentives:** 

- Holders might get boosted liquidity rewards when participating in active pools (eg $NATION / ETH Balancer pool), should the community approve such proposal. The proposal for this is currently being discussed on the [Forum](https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-to-launch-liquidity-rewards/25).

## NFT passports

NFT passport holders are the citizens of Nation3. They are the core users of its services, and simultaneously those that drive forward its progress. Nation3 citizens are the ones that make proposals, conduct research, carry out initiatives, structure themselves into working groups, and do everything else thatâ€™s required to successfully kickstart a cloud nation. They invest their time and expertise into the project, while making use of the funds from the Nation3 DAO.

In the first instance, a **limited edition of Genesis NFTs** can be minted. After that, the DAO can decide whether to issue more passports, how many and when.

NFT passports are non-transferrable, and can only be minted by those that hold the required amount of $veNATION. If a $veNATION holder who is a citizen doesnâ€™t renew their lock and allows for the required $veNATION balance to drop, therefore lacking any long-term commitment, the NFT passport would be burned. This ensures that citizens have long-term economic alignment.

**Holdersâ€™ rights:** 

- Use all the services that Nation3 provides or will provide in the future, including physical spaces.
- Access to certain token-gated parts of public forums, such as Discord.
- Making proposals and making decisions within the Nation3 DAO (provided that those are ratified by veNATION holders).

**Holdersâ€™ responsibilities:** 

- Carrying the bulk of active governance responsibility. They are the only ones that can put proposals forward, and vote them to then be ratified by veNATION holders.

**Holdersâ€™ financial incentives:** 

- Holders might be rewarded through Governance Mining, meaning that they would receive NATION rewards as long as they meet their governance responsibilities. (Not implemented yet)
- All of the veNATION financial incentives, as they are also veNATION holders.

All citizens are veNATION holders, but not all veNATION holders are citizens.

This creates economic alignment while maintaining the checks and balances resulting from both groups participating in governance â€” essentially a bicameral system.

The proposal for this is currently being discussed on the [Forum](https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-to-issue-genesis-nft-passports/26).
